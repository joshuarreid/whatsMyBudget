# WhatsMyBudget Prototype

**WhatsMyBudget** is a Java application that I use for personal budget tracking, category breakdowns, and weekly spending analysis. The app demonstrates interactive UI features for exploring spending data, with a focus on visualization and analysis rather than deployment or production use.

## Features

- **Category Breakdown**: Visualize spending per category and subcategory.
- **Projected vs Actual Spending**: Add and remove projected expenses for future planning.
- **Weekly Analysis**: Click any category to see a detailed weekly breakdown for the current month.
- **Joint and Individual Accounts**: Easily split and attribute joint expenses.
- **Modern UI**: Uses Java Swing components with custom styling.
